# ft_printf - 42cursus

## Development Repository for 42cursus' ft_printf Project

For additional information about 42cursus and its projects, please refer to the [42cursus repository](https://github.com/42cursus).

### About

This project involves recoding the `printf` function. The primary goal is to create a library that contains a simplified version of `printf`. The intention is to enable reuse in future projects without the risk of being flagged as a cheater. This project primarily focuses on learning how to use variadic arguments.

#### TLDR

The project consists of coding a library containing a simplified version of the `printf` function.

### Mandatory

- Format specifiers: `c` `s` `p` `d` `i` `u` `x` `X` `%`

### Usage

#### Requirements

The library is written in the C language and, therefore, requires the gcc compiler and some standard C libraries to run.

#### Instructions

1. **Compiling the library**

   To compile the library, run:

   ```bash
   $ cd path/to/ft_printf && make
